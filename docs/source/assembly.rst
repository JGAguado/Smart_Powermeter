Soldering 
----------
.. Important::
    Please note that some components in this board need to be soldered.

The |Product| comes as a set consisting on a :term:`SMD` pre-soldered board to which you will need to mount the following components:

* `HLK-2M05 <https://www.hlktech.com/en/Goods-39.html>`_ power module, a 2W AC-DC step-down switching power supply module :term:`THT` solderable.
* A 2-Pin 2mm-pitch screw terminal block, for the AC power imput, also :term:`THT` solderable.

.. Note:: 
  When buying the |Product| read the product description to make sure these two components are included, otherwise you might need to get them on your
  own.

The soldering of these two components is quite fast, just make sure not to bend any of the power supply module pins. If you have never soldered or you want to improve your soldering techniques I recommend you

Assembly
--------
Once the board is fully soldered, it is highly recommended to mount it on an enclosure (like the suggested :ref:`enclosure`) to prevent unintended contacts between the bottom 
side of the board (since the hig-voltage pins are exposed).

At this point, and before start connecting the board to high voltages, it is the moment of testing the board and flash it for first time.

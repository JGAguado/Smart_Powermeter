ðŸ’» Programming
===============

There are two main programming methods supported and tested with the |Product|: 
 * ESPHome
 * Arduino

In both scenarios, and if you are using the USB port or the Serial port for programming it, you
will first need to enter the board into flashing mode. For that, press and hold the *Flash* pushbutton
while you reset the board (pressing once the *Reset* pushbutton).

.. Caution::
    When flashing the board, make sure its only powered by the USB/Serial port.
    
ESPHome
---------
`ESPHome <https://esphome.io>`_ is a well known platform for programming ESP-based devices 
with a very little effort. It is configured via YAML files and supports a wide range of functionalities
and sensors.

.. Important::
    For using ESPHome, and all its funcionalities, you need to have a `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io>`_ instance running
    in the same network as your |Product|.

The |Product| already comes with an embeded version of ESPHome, that would only require an :term:`OTA` update
to get it ready to work in your network:

1. Power the board, and let it run for 1-2 minutes. When the board cannot connect to a WiFi network, it will 
   create a fallback hotspot.
2. Use a smartphone or tablet and go to the WiFi settings, connect to the recently created *Smart-Lights-X4* hotspot with the password *smartlights*.
3. Access to the captive portal and open the browser if doesn't pop up automatically.
4. Enter your network setttings and press *Save*.



Now, your ESPHome device is ready to be found by Home Assistant in your network. Add it from the ESPHome section to add 
and edit a customized configuration file.

As an example of such configuration file (and the one flashed on the factory settings of the |Product|) 
with all the :term:`I/O`:

.. literalinclude:: files/configuration.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:


Arduino
--------
If you are still interested in programming directly with the Arduino IDE, the procedure is no 
different than with any other ESP32 devices:

1. Open the Arduino IDE and go to File -> Preferences option.
2. Add to the *Additional Boards Manager URSLs* the url:

.. parsed-literal::

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

3. Close the preferences and open in the menu Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager.
4. Search for *esp32* and install it. This might take some time.
5. Now you can select the board *ESP32 Dev Module* as the target board. Leave the rest of parameters 
   by default.
6. Select the correct port and remember to enter the board into flashing mode before uploading the sketch.
